# HMDA Mortgage Fairness Audit

This repository explores biases present against certain demographic groups in the United States within a compilation of public mortgage records that were filed in accordance with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). This act was enacted in 1975 to keep records of access to the markets to ensure minority racial groups were able to sufficiently obtain life changing loans to improve their economic standings. However, from the analysis conducted, it is apparent that despite the good intent of the act, there still exists non-negligible inequities in the demographic parity of loans granted in the US across difference demographic groups. The primary method that was used to reach this conclusion was through A/B testing with a classifcation prediction model. With the demomgraphic disparity established through data-based evidence, methods to address this were implemented, such as label flipping, and displayed promising results.
